    Objective: Create a HashMap to store names and their corresponding nicknames.
    Steps:
    - Create a new HashMap<String, String>.
    - Add entries to the HashMap where the key is the personâ€™s name and the value is their nickname.
    - Retrieve and print specific nicknames from the HashMap.

Summary:
The Nicknames class creates a HashMap that maps names to nicknames. The names are used as keys,
and the corresponding nicknames are used as values in the HashMap. The program adds three name-nickname
pairs to the HashMap: Matthew (Matt), Daniel (Mix), and Arthur (Artie). The specific nicknames are retrieved
from the HashMap using the names as keys and printed to the console.
